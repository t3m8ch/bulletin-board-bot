Bulletin Board Bot
==================

Bulletin board written in Python using the Aiogram library üêç

Technical requirements
----------------------

#. At the command **/start** bot sends a welcome message with basic commands, 
   including **/help** to see a complete list of commands. 

#. The bot has a command **/browseAds**, which sends messages with inline browse 
   buttons with which the user switches between ads.

#. Between the browse buttons in the middle there is a button to add the current 
   ad to favorites.

#. Ads may or may not contain photos.

#. The bot has a command **/newAd**, which allows you to add a new ad.

#. After running this command the bot sends a new message that requests you 
   to write a text of an ad and attach pictures if it is needed; the user 
   needs to send the message created by user.

#. The message sent by the bot contains an inline button to cancel adding an ad.

#. The bot has a command **/myAds**, which shows ads added by the user, 
   similar to how the command **/browseAds** shows them, but in addition to those 
   buttons is added a button to edit and delete the current ad.

#. When you click on the delete button, the bot will ask you to confirm this 
   operation using the inline button of message, which contains the front of the ad.
   
#. When you click on the edit button, the bot will ask you to send a message with 
   new text; then the bot will send pictures attached to the old ad, depending on whether 
   you want to change the pictures, you should click on the corresponding inline button; 
   if you decide to change the pictures, the bot will ask you to send new; after all operations, 
   the ad is edited; editing can be canceled at any stage.
   

üèÉ How do I run it?
----------------
#. Clone this repository üöÄ

    ::

        git clone https://github.com/t3m8ch/bulletin-board-bot.git
        cd bulletin-board-bot

#. Rename **.example.env** to **.env** üîÑ

    ::

        mv .example.env .env

#. Edit the **.env** file using a text editor üìã

    ::

        TG_TOKEN=Insert_the_telegram_bot_token_here_without_spaces
        ADMINS_ID=List_the_id_of_the_administrators,separated_by_commas_without_spaces
        WEBHOOK_HOST=Insert/the/host/that/will/be/accessed/by/Telegram
        WEBHOOK_PATH=Insert/the/path/to/bot/that/will/be/accessed/by/Telegram
        WEBAPP_HOST=Insert.web.application.host
        WEBAPP_PORT=Insert_web_application_port
        LOG_LEVEL=info

    To use webhook, you only need to specify the environment variable **WEBHOOK_HOST**.
    If this parameter is not specified, long polling is used. If you specify only
    this parameter, it is the default:

    ::

        WEBHOOK_PATH=/bot
        WEBAPP_HOST=localhost
        WEBAPP_PORT=3000

    The LOG_LEVEL parameter is also optional. By default it is **INFO**.
    Valid* values: **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **WARNING**, **ERROR**.

    *\*Valid in this context are the values that are recommended
    for use in the project. Technically, you can specify any parameter that
    is valid for the python logging library by default.*

    *The value of this parameter is case-insensitive*

#. Install the necessary dependencies with the help of **poetry** üîΩ

    ::

        poetry install

#. Now you can run the bot! üéâ

    ::

        poetry run
