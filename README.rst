Bulletin Board Bot
==================

Bulletin board written in Python using the Aiogram library üêç

Technical requirements
----------------------

#. At the command **/start** bot sends a welcome message with basic commands, 
   including **/help** to see a complete list of commands. 

#. The bot has a command **/browseAds**, which sends messages with inline browse 
   buttons with which the user switches between ads.

#. Between the browse buttons in the middle there is a button to add the current 
   ad to favorites.

#. Ads may or may not contain photos.

#. The bot has a command **/newAd**, which allows you to add a new ad.

#. After running this command the bot sends a new message that requests you 
   to write a text of an ad and attach pictures if it is needed; the user 
   needs to send the message created by user.

#. The message sent by the bot contains an inline button to cancel adding an ad.

#. The bot has a command **/myAds**, which shows ads added by the user, 
   similar to how the command **/browseAds** shows them, but in addition to those 
   buttons is added a button to edit and delete the current ad.

#. When you click on the delete button, the bot will ask you to confirm this 
   operation using the inline button of message, which contains the front of the ad.
   
#. When you click on the edit button, the bot will ask you to send a message with 
   new text; then the bot will send pictures attached to the old ad, depending on whether 
   you want to change the pictures, you should click on the corresponding inline button; 
   if you decide to change the pictures, the bot will ask you to send new; after all operations, 
   the ad is edited; editing can be canceled at any stage.
